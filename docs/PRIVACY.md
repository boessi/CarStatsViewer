# Car Stats Viewer - Privacy Policy

This document explains about personal data that Car Stats Viewer, hereinafter referred to as "the App", collects and how it is processed.

## Usage of the App

Car Stats Viewer is capable of recording vehicle data and location. This data is only saved locally on the device and is not accessible by the developer. The local data can be deleted permanently by the user at any time.

Furthermore, the App contains multiple API interfaces. Via these APIs data can be transmitted to third parties. These transmissions require an encrypted connection. To which third party services data is transmitted is only controlled by the user. This data may include exact location data. Transmission of location data can be turned off for the entire App or specific APIs. Refer to the privacy policies of the selected third-party services.

There are no mechanisms in place for collecting personal information or analyzing usage data.

## Sharing usage & diagnostics data via Google

The Android Automotive system may collect some information regarding the usage of the app and will also send crash reports to the developer via internet. This is a feature implemented by the Android system, not specifically by the app. [Check here to learn more about this feature and how to turn it off](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6078260?hl=en).
